        <h3 id="prob-head">PROBLEM </h3>
        <p class="casepara-SGA">I looked to my own experience and others close to me to find out why grocery shopping felt like such a hassle and time consuming and if there was a way to make it more efficient. Starting before even entering the store, some problems included overcrowded parking lots and forgetting shopping lists at home. Once in the store, parents are concerned with the safety of their kids when taking their eyes off of them, getting distracted by their kids and forgetting items, and frustrations dealing with upset children. Other shoppers were conflicted with store layouts being different every place they went and spending so much time circling around trying to find all the items. Store employees also thought there could be a more efficient way for them to take care of job responsibilities without being stopped by lost shoppers. </p>

        <h3 id="prob-head">SOLUTION</h3>
        <p class="casepara-SGA">Create a list application with more organization tools than ever before. An application that has a feeling of community without being overwhelming and distracting and one that takes the thinking out of shopping, that way the user can make the most out of their time, keep their kids safe, and spend more time on what really matters instead of that third trip circling the grocery store. This application indirectly makes the jobs of employees more efficient by cutting down the times they are stopped by lost customers or checking stock for them. </p>

        <p class="casepara-SGA">The user survey was utilized to get insight from those who have used public bus transportation. With this resource, I was able to find out what demographics are, or were, using the bus or are not using it and why. It was vital to ask those who have used public bus systems what they experienced to find pain points. From these surveys and follow up interviews, the problems began to reveal themselves, allowing for a plan of action in eradicating them.</p>

        <p class="comppara-BB">BusyBus competes in the market by providing a very simple and easy to navigate application that integrates all forms of transit. This app should provide a platform for all users outside of the city and within. With so many new transit options like rideshares and bikeshares, it is vital to include this in the planning of trips and routes. From researching these other apps, I was able to understand what features are helpful in making sense of the bus information.  To remedy the problem riders are having on Busy Bus with the influx of buses, notification updates will be pertinent. It  will also be helpful to indicate which bus is coming next indicated by order from first to last in the list. Any disruptions to bus lines will be indicated with color and status updates. Each bus and bus stop will have clickable details as well. </p></div>

        <img src="images/greencsarrow.png" class="pinkarrow-img" alt="red arrow pointing from title to paragraph"></div>



        <p class="casepara-SGA">My first step in the UX process is developing user stories so all necessary actions are accounted for.</p>

        <p class="casepara-SGA">The user stories were crafted towards new and returning public transit goers with a concentration on people traveling. This solution needed to cater to someone who might be completely unfamiliar with a given area and bus system. The stories allow for MVP design with high priority tasks and then carefully consider medium and low priority. I had to figure out which features are a must and which ones are less of a priority. </p>

        <p class="casepara-SGA">Looking back, getting more insight from bus drivers who interact with riders daily would have provided a helpful perspective. I would spend more time in contact with them to see what insights they could provide.</p>

      <img src="images/greencsarrow.png" class="pinkarrow-img" alt="red arrow pointing from title to paragraph"></div>
      <p class="casepara-SGA">This was my first step in design creation. Sketching low fidelity wireframes is an inexpensive step that allows designers to work out pain points. </P>

      <p class="casepara-SGA">Upon opening the app, the first screen would be the map showing the current location as well as the closest bus stop with bus information. There are radio buttons to select the bus out of those available at the stop. The next screen is the fastest route to the particular destination searched (from the first screen). The user must choose to start or view more routes to the location. This screen is missing either a back button or 'X' in the search field. The third screen shows other routes with bike stations as a second mode of transportation. This screen is targeting users who enjoy the newer options of bike and scooter sharing.</p>

      <p class="casepara-SGA">With this particular set of sketches, I didn't find that users were confused but the problem wasn't being solved for and scope creep had trickled into the designs. </p>

      <img src="images/greencsarrow.png" class="pinkarrow-img" alt="red arrow pointing from title to paragraph"></div>
      <p class="casepara-SGA">After the first round of user testing, I found that the problem wasn't being solved for and my designs were getting off track. I reflected back to my user stories and focused on the high priority tasks.</p>

      <p class="casepara-SGA">This set of sketches start with a welcome screen that provides little information or options to avoid overwhelming the user. It first prompts the user if they'd like to go straight to the nearest bus stop. If not, they can choose to go home and have an option to search there. The second screen is the nearest bus stop selection. There is a list of incoming buses and the time of arrival. After selecting the bus, the next screen is the bus route information. </p>

      <p class="casepara-SGA">This solved the problem of riders not knowing which bus to get on or when they'd be arriving. There was still some refining to do from here but the sketches were a helpful start.</p>

      <p class="casepara-SGA">After narrowing in on the goals for the user, I moved the sketches into digital wireframes.</p>

      <p class="casepara-SGA">This part of the process took two iterations with a few adjustments. There weren't many screens to iterate on because I was working on an already-established issue and the user prompts were very quick. I wanted to get user feedback from a digital form of the product because this is more familiar to users and the feedback is more accurate. It was important to make sure the steps to accomplish tasks were clear and understandable. </p>

      <P class="casepara-SGA">With real products in the users' hands, I received quality feedback on how the application would be digested and used.</p>

      <p class="casepara-SGA">For the design, I wanted bold colors that were familiar in the world of commute. These are all colors we unanimously see on the road. For everything else, neutral colors would be used as to not distract users from the messages other colors resembled. However, as I ran usability tests, I found that accessibility wasn't completely accounted for and needed refining. Along with that, the design needed some fine-tuning to make it modern and clean.</p>

  <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
  <p Class="casepara-SGA">The most glaring struggles I had with this project was scope creep. In other words, I let my creative ideas get ahead of the goals. Trying to incorporate newer additions to public transit like bike and scooter shares, this definitely provided a unique feature to transit apps. However, this did not solve the problem riders were having at bus stops that were overwhelmed with new routes and buses.

  By testing, reiterating, and redesigning, I was able to develop a product with a solution that followed accessibility guidelines.
