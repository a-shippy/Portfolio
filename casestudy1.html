          <p id="casepara">This project began with an idea from a client- a desire to enter the cloud service market. It was up to me to establish issues users were facing and then find a solution. Through user research, UX development such as user flows and low fidelity mockups, a final design was reached. The most important piece of this project was the feedback received from each prototype tested with several potential users. </p></article>

        <p id="casepara">Many people found some storage services to be confusing and hard to navigate. Another issue I found among cloud service users was that they were being slowed down and finding themselves disorganized with the need to use so many different applications to complete tasks or projects.</p>

        <h3 id="prob-head">SOLUTION </h3>
        <p id="casepara">Create a cloud storage service that is easy to digest and navigate. Provide one platform that allows users to upload their media one time to edit, save, and send to their clients in a professional presentation. </p>

          <P id="casepara">Another key piece in curating a product that would be competitive in the market was conducting a SWOT analysis on competing services to see what they were already doing right, wrong, and where they can improve. One thing I noticed in the way I was performing my SWOT analysis this time was that it was limiting by trying to do an internal analysis on companies I didnâ€™t have incites on. I think I might have gotten more out of this by analyzing it in relation to my own service. </p>

        <ul class="comp-exp-para">
        <li class="SWOT">Among the strengths of these services, Box and Dropbox both allow for plugin features if the standard service is not enough. A strength of iCloud is its integration within products. This increases users by default if they own Apple products. </li>

        <li class="SWOT">A weakness of Dropbox is that they do not provide many upgrade features from one level to the next, taking away motivation to choose a more expensive tier. I found the Box's business interface had a slower upload time than competition, pushing some companies away. Apple has optimized iCloud for Apple users, narrowing their market. </li>

        <li class="SWOT">Although successful, I found there were opportunities for growth for all of them. Dropbox has a music and media feature that is very basic and not a selling point. To widen their customer base, they can refine these features. Box has a less than ideal syncing system. If they integrate block-level syncing, it will make collaborating and syncing more efficient and therefore more competitive with Dropbox. Apple doesn't have any features that allow you to utilize tools, just simply store. With the ability to edit and collaborate on files, they would level themselves with the competition.</li></ul>

        <ul class="test-exp-para">
        <li class="User">My first point of user testing was done in the digital wireframe mockup stage. I found the most difficult part of this was trying to assist the users through the unfamiliar fidelity of the website. Some of the feedback I received in this stage was that the user did not want to have to scroll to find important information. With this, I brought all important CTA and information to the top of the screens. </li>

        <li class="User">After integrating the feedback from those who will be using the product, I was able to turn to more refined eyes. My next stage was feedback from an array of mentors and critique sessions. Knowing best practices, they recommended some changes such as making the CTA buttons the same throughout the website to make it recongizable. A lot of changes had to happen to the Business Dashboard. The layout nor the elements were very familiar. I revamped the entire layout but specifically focused on navigation buttons and the icon menu.   </li>

        <li class="User">The final changes incorporated similar design aspects between personal and business dashboards while maintaining a modern yet different, refreshing aesthetic. The ultimate goal is for the design and service to be easily navigated based off of processing expectations. </li></ul>

          <h2>___ Conclusion</h2>
          <p id="casepara">Ultimately, design is user-centered. It is making tasks seamless and tapping into what is familiar to provide something delightful. Producing a website that provides both familiar elements and visual design that is entirely new should be refreshing and easy, like breathing. Thus, the Olympus Cloud was created with more organizing options as well as application features to simplify workflows.</p>
