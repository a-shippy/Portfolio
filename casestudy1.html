          <p id="casepara">This project began with an idea from a client- a desire to enter the cloud service market. It was up to me to establish issues users were facing and then find a solution. Through user research, UX development such as user flows and low fidelity mockups, a final design was reached. The most important piece of this project was the feedback received from each prototype tested with several potential users. </p></div>

        <h3 id="prob-head">PROBLEM </h3>
        <p id="casepara">Many people found some storage services to be confusing and hard to navigate. Another issue I found among cloud service users was that they were being slowed down and finding themselves disorganized with the need to use so many different applications to complete tasks or projects.</p>

        <h3 id="prob-head">SOLUTION </h3>
        <p id="casepara">Create a cloud storage service that is easy to digest and navigate. Provide one platform that allows users to upload their media one time to edit, save, and send to their clients in a professional presentation. </p>

          <p id="casepara">In order to establish holes in the growing cloud storage market, I conducted a user survey to gauge who, what, and why people were using this type of service. I also was looking for any opportunities they were consciously aware of or frustrations they have with what is currently offered. This shed some light on potential holes in the market that I could target</p>

          <P id="casepara">Another key piece in curating a product that would be competitive in the market was conducting a SWOT analysis on competing services to see what they were already doing right, wrong, and where they can improve. One thing I noticed in the way I was performing my SWOT analysis this time was that it was limiting by trying to do an internal analysis on companies I didnâ€™t have incites on. I think I might have gotten more out of this by analyzing it in relation to my own service. </p>

          <h2>___ Conclusion</h2>
          <p id="casepara">Ultimately, design is user-centered. It is making tasks seamless and tapping into what is familiar to provide something delightful. Producing a website that provides both familiar elements and visual design that is entirely new should be refreshing and easy, like breathing. Thus, the Olympus Cloud was created with more organizing options as well as application features to simplify workflows.</p>
