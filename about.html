      <!-- About me -->
      <article class="context">
      <p class="aboutpara">My name is Alexa (not THAT Alexa). Something you might find fascinating is that I am a hybrid strength athlete. I constantly find new ways to push my body to the limits, recover, and take care of my health and then repeat almost every day. The chance to suffer for improvement is why I choose this. This year I am attempting to break a few Drug Tested World records in Powerlifting.</p>

      <p class="aboutpara">Sports and being active was what I was brought up on. It wasn’t until I was a bit older before I realized that I was creative. As a teenager, I would spend hours coding and manipulating my MySpace page to make it unrecognizable. This turned into my friends recruiting me to do the same to theirs. To be more productive with my eye for design, I joined my high school’s yearbook staff where I learned design theory such as hierarchy, color, and typography.</p>

      <p class="aboutpara"> I attended the University of Hawaii as an official Rainbow Warrior and graduated from the University of South Florida. I chose to pursue Communication because I knew my goal was to help people but I wasn’t sure in what capacity. This degree has allowed me to learn human behavior, interaction, and communication.</p>

      <p class="aboutpara">I refined my eye for design with photography, using it as a vessel to communicate people's uplifting stories of tribulations and hope. I later became an official photographer and graphic designer for a strength training company. After spending a decade in the restaurant industry as a server and stepping into design and communication, I know my foundation is perfect for understanding the way humans think and navigate daily life.</p>

      <p class="aboutpara">I now create frictionless experiences on the web. Leaving my photography, social media, and hospitality positions was a leap of faith. UX/UI is a full circle that started with web coding for fun and is now my career, allowing me to create products that assist in human experiences. I don't want to just design effortless experiences, I want to create products that can make this world a better place. </p>
